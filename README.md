This repository contains our implementation of state-of-the-art *anomaly detection* models and [ARM-Net](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3457321) 
for **Log-based Anomaly Detecion**.
Log-based anomaly detection aims to discover abnormal system behaviors (*binary classification*) by analyzing log sequences that are generated routinely by the system at runtime.

### [Data Format](https://github.com/nusdbsystem/ARM-Net/blob/log/data_loader.py)

Each log is a message in unstructued data format (raw text), which can be parsed into structured data format of a number of key information *fields*, e.g., date, pid, level, event ID and etc.

##### [Feature Extraction](https://github.com/nusdbsystem/ARM-Net/blob/log/data_loader.py)

1. Sampling method (sample a log sequence for anomaly detection)
   * window-based: extract features for detection from **a sliding window** over the log sequence
   * session-based: extract features for detection from **the whole log sequence**
2. Features
   * sequential: a sequence of log **eventID**s
   * quantitative: the **event count vector** of the sequence
   * semantic: a sequence of the **semantic embedding** of log eventIDs
   * tabular: a sequence of logs in **tabular data** format (time, date, pid, ...)

##### Benchmark Datasets

* HDFS
  * generated by Hadoop-based map-reduce jobs on more than 200 Amazon EC2 nodes.
  * consists of 575,061 blocks
    * each involves a sequence of log messages
    * collected during the execution of a program (writing, closing, and deleting files etc.)
    * labelled as normal and anomaly by experienced Hadoop domain experts
* BGL
  * collected from a BlueGene/L supercomputer system with 131,072 processors
  * each log message is labelled as a non-alert message with a tag and a alert message otherwise
